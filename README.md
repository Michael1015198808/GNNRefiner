# GNNRefiner

This repository contains the implementation of our OOPSLA paper: [Scaling Abstraction Refinement for Program Analyses in Datalog using Graph Neural Networks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689765).

For ready-to-run artifacts, please visit [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/12670438).

We are currently working on refactoring the code to enhance readability and reusability. Stay tuned for updates! :smiley:
